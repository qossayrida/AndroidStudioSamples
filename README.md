# AndroidStudioSamples

This laboratory manual is designed for the ENCS515 Advanced Computer Systems Engineering course at Birzeit University. It includes a series of experiments aimed at providing hands-on experience in various aspects of Android programming and Spring Boot.

---

### EXP. No. 1. Introduction to Android Programming

In this experiment, you will learn the basics of Android programming. You'll start by downloading Android Studio and creating a "Hello World" application. This will help you understand the various parts of an Android application and how to install and run it on both an emulator and a physical device.

### EXP. No. 2. Android Layouts

This experiment focuses on Android layouts. You will learn about views, view groups, layouts, and widgets, and how they relate to each other. The experiment also covers how to declare layouts dynamically at runtime and how to add widgets dynamically. Additionally, you will learn how to switch between activities and use events and event listeners.

### EXP. No. 3. Using Intents and Notifications

In this experiment, you will explore the use of intents and notifications in Android. You will learn how to create and use both explicit and implicit intents to navigate between activities and how to trigger notifications to alert the user about important events in your application.

### EXP. No. 4. SQLite Database

This experiment introduces you to SQLite databases in Android. You will learn how to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on a SQLite database. This will provide you with the skills to manage local data storage within your Android applications.

### EXP. No. 5. Frame Animation and Tween Animation in Android

In this experiment, you will learn about animations in Android. You will explore both frame animation and tween animation techniques, understanding how to apply them to create engaging user interfaces.

### EXP. No. 6. Singleton and Shared Preferences

This experiment covers the Singleton design pattern and Shared Preferences in Android. You will learn how to implement the Singleton pattern to manage global application state and how to use Shared Preferences to store and retrieve simple data persistently.

### EXP. No. 7. Fragments

In this experiment, you will delve into the use of fragments in Android. You will learn how to create and manage fragments, understanding their lifecycle and how to use them to build flexible and dynamic user interfaces.

### EXP. No. 8. Integrating REST API into Android Application

This experiment focuses on integrating REST APIs into your Android application. You will learn how to make network requests, parse JSON responses, and display the data in your application. This will enable your application to interact with web services and retrieve dynamic data.

### EXP. No. 9. Spring Boot Part 1

In this experiment, you will be introduced to Spring Boot, a framework for building Java-based web applications. You will learn the basics of setting up a Spring Boot project and creating simple RESTful web services.

### EXP. No. 10. Spring Boot Part 2

This experiment builds on the previous one, diving deeper into Spring Boot. You will learn about more advanced features and configurations, enabling you to create robust and scalable web applications.

## Project

The project for this lab is the [Flight Reservation App](https://github.com/qossayrida/FlightReservationApp), which demonstrates practical applications of Android programming.
